description: Investigates a live or recent Grafana incident using the timebuddy-incident-investigator MCP tools - ingests alert details (a pasted Grafana URL, alert JSON, webhook payload, or just a description), replays the underlying queries over the incident window, checks against baselines, looks for correlated signals, and produces an evidence-linked verdict. Use whenever someone pastes alert/incident details, mentions being paged or on-call, or asks what's going on with a service.

# Investigate

Alert details, if any were included when this skill was invoked: $ARGUMENTS

This is the reactive path — something is (or was) firing and someone needs an answer quickly.
Drive the tools below yourself; don't just describe what could be done. The person invoking this
generally won't know the tool names or the right order to call them in — that's exactly what this
skill exists to handle for them.

## Pipeline

1. **Normalize whatever was given.** Call `get_alert_context` with whichever of `url`,
   `alertJson`, or `webhookPayload` matches what was pasted above (a Grafana dashboard/panel/
   alert-rule URL, a raw alert JSON object, or a full Alertmanager webhook body). If nothing
   usable was given, ask for one of those three — a pasted Slack/email alert often has a URL in
   it even if the surrounding text doesn't look like structured data.
   - **Recognize stripped-link pasted alerts and ask, don't guess.** Slack (and some email
     clients) turn a message's hyperlinks into plain anchor text when copied — you'll see link
     *titles* like "Dashboard", "Runbook", "Silence", "Graylog: APIGW 5xx" with no URL anywhere
     near them, alongside real-looking alert labels. This is NOT "truly nothing to paste" — a
     real link exists, it just didn't survive the copy. Say so plainly and ask for it directly
     (e.g. "Slack strips links when copied as plain text — could you grab the Dashboard or alert
     link itself, or the alert's timestamp?") before falling back to step 4's label/description
     search. Guessing the dashboard and time window from labels alone when a precise link was one
     click away wastes several tool calls and turns; asking up front is faster for everyone.
   - Only skip straight to step 4 when the person genuinely has no link and no JSON to give you
     (e.g. they're describing the incident from memory, or pasted a screenshot's text by hand).
   - If the response includes a `knowledge` field, a "Timebuddy knowledge" dashboard published
     product-specific context for this alert (owner, known false positives, runbook links) —
     fold it into your verdict in step 6. Absent means nothing's been published for this alert's
     product, not an error; don't go looking for it yourself (`get_product_context` exists for
     that, but `get_alert_context` already tried).

2. **Note the resolved connection.** The response includes `resolvedConnectionId` when it could
   determine which Grafana connection the alert belongs to. Pass that same id as the `connection`
   parameter on every tool call for the rest of this investigation — don't re-resolve it per call.
   - If `resolvedConnectionId` is missing and `alertContext.warnings` mentions being unable to
     determine the connection, the warning text lists the available connection ids — ask the
     person which environment this is (they usually know, even if the alert link didn't say) and
     use that as `connection` going forward.

3. **Get the primary signal(s).**
   - If you only have `alertContext.dashboardUid` with **no** `panelId` — a bare dashboard link
     (e.g. someone pasted a `/d/:uid?var-...` URL with no `viewPanel`/`panelId` in it) — call
     `render_dashboard` with that same `url` first. It executes every queryable panel on the
     dashboard in one call, using the url's own time window and variable overrides automatically.
     **Don't manually chain `fetch_dashboard` -> guess which panel -> `resolve_panel_queries` as a
     substitute for this** — that's more tool calls to arrive at the same per-panel series
     `render_dashboard` already returns directly. Skim `panels[].series`/`stats` (and `title`) for
     the panel(s) that actually answer the question, then drop into the steps below on just those
     panels for threshold/baseline analysis.
   - **On a wide window and/or a dashboard with many panels, pass `includePoints: false`.** Every
     series' `stats` (min/max/mean/count/nonZeroCount) is computed and returned either way — only
     the raw `points` array is dropped. A multi-day, all-panel render with points included routinely
     overflows the tool response to a saved file, forcing a jq/bash detour to recover numbers `stats`
     already had. Re-run the one or two specific panels you actually need points for (screenshot,
     `execute_query_window`'s `threshold`, etc.) once you've picked them out from the compact survey.
   - **Note each panel's own `title` from this response.** You'll want it as `panelTitle` in step 3
     below on any dashboard where panel ids collide (see that step's note).
   - **Table and matrix panels can look empty when they aren't.** These are frequently built from
     Grafana transformations (joins, filters, field overrides, computed columns) applied on top of
     the raw query — `execute_query_window`/`render_dashboard` only ever return each query target's
     *raw* series, never the transformed/rendered result the panel actually displays. A raw series
     coming back empty or unremarkable does **not** mean the panel shows nothing; it may just mean
     the transformation that produces the interesting column isn't visible in the raw query alone.
     If you're asked to identify specific rows/cells in a table or matrix (e.g. "which hosts
     failed"), or a table/matrix panel's raw data looks empty or surprising, call `screenshot_panel`
     on it and look at the actual rendered image before concluding there's no data — don't stop at
     raw series alone. **The inline image `screenshot_panel` returns is for you to look at — it is
     not guaranteed to reach the person you're talking to.** Every call also saves the PNG to disk
     and returns its path as `savedTo`; always state that path in your response (e.g. "screenshot
     saved to <path> — open it to see the table") so they have something to actually look at, not
     just your description of what you saw in it. If you need the transformed data *as data* rather
     than a picture (e.g. to cite specific values in your verdict), `export_panel_csv` can capture it
     directly — check its `transformationsApplied` field; `true` means the file is Grafana's own
     transformed output, not just the raw per-query series.
   - **Check `unresolvedAllVariables` before trusting a panel's scope.** `render_dashboard`,
     `resolve_panel_queries`, `execute_query_window`, and `detect_correlated_anomalies` best-effort
     resolve a `$__all`-selected variable to its real value list, but some datasources/query shapes
     can't be resolved this way and fall back to matching *everything* that datasource has ever
     recorded for that field — silently far broader than what the dashboard/panel actually shows. If
     a variable a panel depends on shows up in `unresolvedAllVariables`, treat that panel's results as
     unscoped: don't apply a naming-convention guess (e.g. matching a hostname prefix) to narrow down
     which rows are actually in scope — screenshot the panel or ask the person directly instead.
   - Once you have a specific `dashboardUid`/`panelId` (from `alertContext`, or picked out of a
     `render_dashboard` survey above):
   - **Pass `panelTitle` alongside `panelId` on every call below whenever you already know it**
     (from `alertContext.panelURL`'s resolved panel, or a prior `render_dashboard`/`fetch_dashboard`
     call) — don't wait for an ambiguity error to add it. Some dashboards have more than one panel
     sharing an id (a provisioning bug, not Grafana's repeat-panel feature); `execute_query_window`/
     `validate_baseline`/`detect_correlated_anomalies` all reject an ambiguous `panelId` outright
     rather than guessing, listing the candidate titles in the error — but that costs a whole extra
     round trip of retries you can just avoid up front by always passing the title when you have it.
   - Pass `includePoints: false` when you're re-confirming something `stats`/`briefExcursions`/
     `runs` already told you and don't need the raw series — same tradeoff as `render_dashboard`'s
     option above, for the same reason.
   - `execute_query_window` with `dashboardUid`, `panelId`, `startsAtMs` (use `alertContext.startsAt`),
     `connection` — this gets you the incident window, a pre-window buffer, and baseline control
     windows in one call. Every series in the response already includes `stats`
     (min/max/mean/count/nonZeroCount) — check that first for quick questions like "was there any
     traffic at all" or "what's the min/max here" instead of writing jq/python over a saved
     tool-output file to compute the same thing yourself, even for a substitute panel you fall back
     to (e.g. because the primary panel errors or times out) — this isn't just for the one panel the
     alert points at. If you know or can guess a meaningful threshold for the metric (e.g. an
     uptime-style series where 1.0 = fully healthy, a known SLO threshold, or 0 for "any activity at
     all" on a volume/count metric), pass `threshold`/`thresholdDirection` in the *same* call — it
     returns each series' precise dip/spike windows (start, end, duration, min/max) directly,
     including whether sibling series in the same panel (other hosts/cells/nodes) show the same dip.
     **Do this instead of fetching raw points and writing jq/python to find dip boundaries
     yourself** — that's exactly what `threshold` is for, and scripting it ad hoc from a saved
     tool-output file is slower and more error-prone mid-incident.
   - **A query against an InfluxDB-backed panel that times out or aborts is often hitting
     InfluxDB's own hard ~15s query timeout, not a transient fluke** — this server's own default
     request timeout is coincidentally the same ~15s, so a heavy query (a fine-grained `GROUP BY
     time(5s)`-style aggregate over a wide window is the usual culprit) can fail on either side of
     that race. Don't just retry the identical call, and especially don't retry several of them in
     parallel expecting one to get through — that adds load and makes the timeout *more* likely, not
     less. Instead narrow the window, drop to a coarser aggregation, or fall back to a cheaper/
     non-aggregated target for that same series, and prefer calling sequentially over an
     InfluxDB-backed datasource rather than in parallel once you've seen one timeout.
   - `validate_baseline` with the same panel/window to get a real classification
     (`statistically-unusual` vs `common-during-normal-operations`) instead of eyeballing numbers.
     **Always check each series' `briefExcursions` too, even when `classification` says common** —
     that classification is based on the whole window's mean, which can dilute a real, sharp,
     short-lived event (e.g. a health signal fully down for a few minutes inside a much longer
     window) into looking routine. `briefExcursions` is a separate, point-level check against the
     same baseline and will still catch it. Don't just trust a "common" label at face value.
   - **`classification: baseline-all-zero` means there is no baseline to compare against.** Every
     control window was flat zero and the incident window isn't — something that never happened
     is happening. That's real information, but it is *not* a statistical result: `zScore` is
     `NaN`, and no magnitude of it can make the finding statistically strong, because there's no
     spread to be strong relative to. Report it as a presence change, cite the actual numbers
     from `incidentStats` (peak, nonzero sample count) rather than any sigma figure, and lean on
     corroboration — did the alert's own threshold cross, did anything correlate — to decide
     whether it matters. Don't describe it as "highly unusual" or similar; you don't know that.
   - **A `runsTotal` or `briefExcursionsTotal` field means the list next to it was truncated.**
     Both appear only when a series produced more than 1000 threshold crossings, and both report
     the real count. Don't read the truncated list as the complete set, and don't reason about
     "the first crossing" from it — a series that noisy is telling you the threshold or the
     window is wrong for it, so re-query a narrower window (or a coarser aggregation) and look
     again rather than summarizing what came back.

4. **If there's no dashboard/panel link** (warnings said so, or there was nothing to paste in
   step 1), fall back to `find_related_dashboards` using `alertContext.labels` (or whatever labels
   the person gave you) to locate relevant dashboards. If the only thing you have is a product/
   service name in plain language (e.g. "block storage is degraded") rather than an exact metric
   or label value, use `find_related_dashboards`'s `query` param instead — a free-text substring
   match against metric names and dashboard/panel titles. Then proceed as in step 3 once you have
   a candidate panel.
   - **If `find_related_dashboards` comes back empty for a specific metric/measurement name you
     have independent evidence should exist** (it's named in the alert itself, an error message, or
     a log line — not just a hunch), and the environment is InfluxDB-backed, `discover_influxdb_schema`
     is a last-resort fallback: it queries the datasource's own schema directly rather than only
     what's been dashboarded. Use it only in that specific situation, not as a routine step or a
     first move — pass the exact name as `searchTerm`. `find_related_dashboards` coming back empty
     just means no dashboard visualizes it yet; that's itself worth reporting (a real observability
     gap on the dashboard-owning team's side), separate from whether the metric exists at all.

5. **Check blast radius**, once you have a primary panel: `detect_correlated_anomalies` with
   `primaryDashboardUid`/`primaryPanelId`/`startsAtMs`/`primaryLabels`/`connection` — omit
   `candidates` to let it auto-discover across the metric index. This tells you what else moved
   around the same time, which is often the actual answer to "is this real."

   **Call it once per `scope` tier, narrowest first, and report each tier's result before widening —
   don't just call `all-connections` straight away.** Default (`scope: "product"`) checks the primary
   dashboard plus whatever its own Timebuddy knowledge panel declares as its ops/SLI dashboards and
   dependencies (falls back to just the primary dashboard alone if no knowledge is published for this
   alert — check `productScope.source` to know which happened). Say what that tier found — even
   "nothing correlated within the product" is a real, useful thing to report mid-investigation, not
   just a step to silently pass through. Then look at `nextScope`/`nextScopeCandidateCount` in the
   response: if `nextScopeCandidateCount` is `0`, there's nothing to gain by widening, say so and
   move on. If `nextScopeCandidateCount` is missing instead of a number, it's genuinely unknown (not
   zero) — widening to `scope: "connection"`/`"all-connections"` involves crawling every dashboard on
   a connection the first time (or once its cache goes stale), which this tool only ever does for
   connections the requested scope actually needs, so it won't pay that cost just to answer a count
   you didn't ask for. Otherwise call again with `scope: "connection"`, report that, and only escalate
   to `scope: "all-connections"` — the broadest and most expensive tier — when you still don't have a
   confident answer. Skipping straight to the widest scope costs several times the query volume for
   no benefit when the narrower tier would have already answered it.

   **This only checks *other dashboards* — it won't catch a primary panel that's a narrow/synthetic
   signal (e.g. a health-check-style series) overstating impact that sibling panels on the *same*
   dashboard would reveal.** Especially for an undirected "find errors"/"what's going on" investigation
   with no specific alert pointing at one exact panel: before asserting severity from a single
   high-deviation panel, check whether the same dashboard has sibling panels measuring the same
   underlying thing at a different, more concrete grain — real traffic/volume, per-account or
   per-method breakdowns, success-rate panels — over the same incident window (`execute_query_window`
   or a quick `render_dashboard` re-check with `includePoints: false` is usually enough). A panel
   reading "0% for 5 hours" next to real traffic that only dipped 4% and was concentrated on one
   account is a materially different, more useful finding than the first panel alone.

   A stat panel using Grafana's built-in "-- Dashboard --" datasource (re-displays another panel's
   already-computed value; no backend to query) is detected automatically — it never shows up as a
   404 or an `executionError`, it carries `mirrorsPanelIds` instead. Read the referenced panel(s)
   directly rather than investigating the 404 yourself; there's nothing to fix, it's this Grafana
   feature working as designed.

   If a panel's queries fail with something like "404 Data source not found" for any *other*
   reason, check whether its datasource reference is a literal name rather than a UID (not a
   `$variable` — those are already handled). `list_datasources` tells you whether a datasource
   matching that name still exists under a different UID — if it does, that's a real, reportable
   finding ("this dashboard's datasource reference is stale, here's the correct UID"), not a dead
   end. If nothing close shows up, say so plainly rather than retrying — that dashboard needs a
   Grafana-side fix, not something any tool call here can resolve.

6. **Assemble the verdict**: `summarize_findings` with the baseline result, correlated results,
   and an `evidence` array of dashboard/panel links you gathered along the way. Pass
   `validate_baseline`'s `briefExcursions` through in `baseline` unchanged, not just the top-level
   `classification` — `summarize_findings` now folds that in itself, so it never returns
   `likely-false-positive` while brief excursions are sitting right there unexamined (it returns
   `inconclusive` instead when the window-mean says "common" but excursions say otherwise). This
   used to be entirely on the calling agent to catch by eye, per the `briefExcursions` guidance in
   step 3 above — passing the array through now makes that check real instead of easy to forget.
   Every tool above
   (`get_alert_context`'s `dashboardUrl`, `execute_query_window`/`validate_baseline`'s `url`,
   `detect_correlated_anomalies`'s `primaryUrl` and each correlated result's `url`,
   `find_related_dashboards`'s per-match `url`) already returns a ready-to-click Grafana link at
   the exact panel and time window — use those directly as `evidence[].url`. **Never construct a
   dashboard URL yourself** (e.g. by guessing at `/d/{uid}` or copying a base URL from somewhere
   else) — the tools already know the right connection's base URL and the right query params;
   hand-building one risks pointing at the wrong Grafana instance or a broken link.
   `summarize_findings` returns **structured data only — no prose**. Reading its `reasons` and
   `evidence` fields, write the actual human-readable incident note yourself: what fired, whether
   it's real, why (cite the specific baseline/correlation numbers), and the links you collected so
   the person can click straight through and verify anything you said. This last step is not
   optional — a bare JSON dump back to a NOC person on a live incident is not useful in the flow.
   If you called `screenshot_panel` anywhere above, list each screenshot's `savedTo` path next to
   the panel it came from — it's evidence for "why do you say that," and the file is the only
   reliable way the person actually gets to see it (see step 3 above). If `get_alert_context`
   returned a `knowledge` field (step 1), weave its content into the note (e.g. a known false
   positive, an owning team, a runbook link) rather than leaving it as a separate, unexplained blob.

**If asked to archive, export, or hand off a panel's data** (not just describe it) — for a
postmortem, a report, or further analysis in another tool — use `export_panel_csv` on that panel
rather than pasting numbers by hand. It writes a real CSV file to disk and returns its path; state
that path in your response the same way you would a `screenshot_panel` `savedTo` path. Table panels
export as-is; timeseries/graph panels come out as one UTC-timestamp column plus one column per
series. This is a follow-up action once someone has a specific panel in mind, not a replacement for
`execute_query_window`'s stats/threshold analysis during the investigation itself.

**Never read this server's own persistent, unredacted data store directly** (`metric-index.json`,
`connections.json`, or anything else under its data directory), **even if you can find where it's
stored on disk — always go through the MCP tools above.** That data was never redacted for you to
see; a tool's own return value always is. If a tool doesn't seem to cover what you need, that's a
sign to use a different tool/param (`query` for free-text search, `connection` to scope a search),
not to go around the tool layer, especially mid-incident when speed matters and a wrong shortcut is
expensive.

This is a different thing from a tool response the harness itself saved to a file because it was too
large to return inline (you'll see this for a wide-window `render_dashboard`/`execute_query_window`
call) — that file **is** the same already-redacted output you'd have gotten inline, just spilled to
disk for size reasons. Reading it back, or running `jq`/`grep` over it to pull out specific fields
without loading the whole thing into context, is fine and often the right move for a large survey —
just prefer `includePoints: false` up front (step 3 above) so you don't need the detour in the first
place.
